# Portfolio Revisited

Now that you've incorporated flexbox into your CSS repertoire, it's time to revisit your portfolio. For this project, you'll start from scratch, and build a full page of content that represents your portfolio. You'll start by creating a brand new `index.html` file as well as a `styles.css` file.

You make take some creative liberties in your portfolio's design as long as you meet the following requirements:

## Requirements

* You should make at least three commits in git using the command line
* Your project should be hosted on GitHub Pages
* Mutiple containers must use flexbox (`display: flex`)
* You must have containers that display their content both horizontally or vertically
* You must incorporate all of the following elements
  * links
  * one or more images
  * use of color
  * multiple sizes of text
